### module1/src

    ### [1.4] Mastering Basic Data Types: TypeScript helps you manage different types of data. You'll learn about numbers, strings, Booleans, and other data types that make your code more organized.

    ### [1.5] Object Power, Optional and Literal Types: Explore the world of objects in TypeScriptâ€”how to structure them, define optional properties, and even use literal types for greater control.

    ### [1.6] Function in TypeScript: Functions are the building blocks of any program. We'll teach you how to write functions in TypeScript! You'll learn about features like parameter typing and return type definition.

    ### [1.7] Spread and Rest Operator

    ### [1.8] Destructuring in TypeScript: Simplify working with complex objects using destructuringâ€”a powerful technique that allows you to extract specific data with ease.

    ### [1.9] Type Aliases in TypeScript: Learn how to create type aliases, which are like nicknames for complex types. This will make your code cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.

    ### [1.10] Union and Intersection Types: Imagine being able to define variables that can hold different types of data. That's the power of union and intersection types in TypeScript!

    ### [1.11] Ternary, Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing: Discover special operators like ternary operators, optional chaining, and nullish coalescing. These operators make your code more concise and safer to work with.

    ### [1.12] Unveiling Never, Unknown & Nullable Types: TypeScript offers advanced type concepts like "never," "unknown," and nullable types. These advanced concepts give you more flexibility when dealing with unexpected or nullable values.

### module2

    ### [2.1] Type assertion/type narrowing:

            Sometimes TypeScript might be unsure of a variable's type. We'll learn how to give hints (type assertions) and refine types (narrowing) for better code safety.

    ### [2.2] Interface, type vs interface:

            Remember data types like numbers and strings? Interfaces are like blueprints for your objects, defining their structure. You'll learn the difference and how to use them effectively.

    ### [2.3] Introduction to generics:

            A generic is a feature that allows a function, class, or interface to work with different types of data.

    ### [2.4] Generics with Interfaces:

            Combine the power of interfaces and generics! Learn how to build functions that work with objects following specific blueprints (interfaces), keeping your code safe and reusable.

    ### [2.5] Function with generics:

            Craft functions that can handle different data types using generics. We'll show you how to define what types your functions can work with.

    ### [2.6] Constraints in typeScript:

            Sometimes, you might want to limit the types generics can work with. We'll explore constraints, like setting rules for what types are allowed in your generic functions.

    ### [2.7] Constraint using key of:

            Get even more control! Learn how to use a tool called "keyof" to define constraints based on an object's properties.

    ### [2.8] Asynchronous typeScript:

            Web development often involves waiting for things. We'll show you how to handle these situations (asynchronous) safely and clearly in TypeScript.

    ### [2.9] Conditional Types:

            Imagine types that change based on what happens in your program! Discover conditional types, a powerful feature for creating dynamic type structures.

    ### [2.10] Mapped types:

            Want to transform existing types into something new? Explore mapped types, a technique for reshaping types based on your defined rules.

    ### [2.11] Utility Types:

            TypeScript comes with built-in helpers (utility types) that offer common functionalities. We'll explore these helpers to make your code shorter and easier to maintain.

By conquering these topics, you'll be well on your way to becoming a TypeScript whiz and crafting superior web applications! ðŸ’¥
